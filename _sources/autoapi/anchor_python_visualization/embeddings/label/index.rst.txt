   anchor_python_visualization.embeddings.label.LabelledFeatures




.. py:class:: LabelledFeatures


   Maintains separate data-frames for embeddings and labels, but linked in order and count.

   Both data-frames must have the same number of rows, ordred identically.

   .. py:attribute:: features
      :type: pandas.DataFrame

      Data-frame containing only feature-values (numeric) with each row assigned an identifier.

   .. py:attribute:: labels
      :type: pandas.Series

      Series with labels for each item in ``df_features``.

      The series must have the same size and order as ``embeddings``.

   .. py:attribute:: image_paths
      :type: Optional[pandas.Series]

      Optional series with a path to an image for each item.

      The series must have the same size and order as ``embeddings``.

   .. py:method:: number_items() -> int

      Returns the number of items (i.e. rows) in the data-frames/series.


   .. py:method:: sample_without_replacement(sample_size: int) -> LabelledFeatures

      Samples without replacement (taking identical rows from each member data-frame/series).

      :param sample_size: number of items to sample

      :returns: a newly created :class:`LabelledFeatures` containing the sample.

      :raises InsufficientRowsException: if there are fewer rows available than :code:`sample_size`.
