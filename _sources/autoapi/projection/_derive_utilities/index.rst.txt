   :param unprojected: the original data-frame from which the projection was derived
   :param projected: the projection derived from `unprojected`
   :param feature_prefix: a prefix to use in feature names to become `feature_prefix0`, `feature_prefix1` etc.
   :return: returns a data-frame with identical row order and sze to df_orig but with embeddings from projection
