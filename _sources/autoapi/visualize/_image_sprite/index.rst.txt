.. function:: create_sprite_at(image_paths: pandas.Series, sprite_path: str, image_size_in_sprite: Tuple[(int, int)]) -> None

   Creates an image-sprite in the format expected by TensorBoard

   This image sprite is a tiled (like a checkboard) version of small identically-sized images (patches) in the order:
     left->right (first)
     top->down (second).

   The sprite MUST always be of square dimensionality, so any unused patches are left blank at the end.

   :param image_paths: a series of image-paths for each image that should exist in the sprite (in that order)
   :param sprite_path: the path to write the sprite to
   :param image_size_in_sprite: the size of each image inside the sprite
